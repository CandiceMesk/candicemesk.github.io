Le Creuset opened a pop-up store in Fourways Mall not so long ago, advertising discounts of up to 60%. I could not refuse, as much as I am no fan of that mall. I arrived to find many empty shelves, but I noticed these little gems and I bought two of them. 

These trays are made from hard anodised forged aluminium (whatever that is), and coated in the toughened non stick that I've come to depend on. It feels like the perfect blend between cast iron and a baking tray. The tray heats up evenly, and the food just glides right off when the oven is done working its magic.

I love it for lamb and I've even used it for pizzas! It's easy to pick up with oven gloves or a folded dish towel, but of course, be quick. It'll stay nice and hot for a while, so you can just pop it straight onto your table and watch as the food continues to sizzle away.

You can use metal or silicon utensils to turn your food around mid-cook. Hell, you could probably use it as a plate if you wanted to. I'm generally one to avoid scratching my darling le creuset so I opt for a pair of silicon tongs or turn the meat very gently with a fork. 

This little guy is a breeze to clean by hand so there's really no need for the dishwasher, which can be harmful to non-stick ovenware over time. Once it's cooled down, all you need is a soft sponge, some dishwashing liquid and a couple of light scrubs. Under hot water, all the oil melts away and your tray is beautifully clean. It dries naturally with no sponge marks, so leave it to dry overnight and it'll be ready for your next cook!
